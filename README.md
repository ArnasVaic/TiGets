# TiGets 🎟️

## Front-end setup

You should be able to run this command (so firstly and try this):

yarn start (directory .../FE/tigets)

For everything else i guess just google. Install yarn, then using yarn install react and redux (idk if that is neccessary) and time to time run the command 'yarn' to download all this tool updates.
